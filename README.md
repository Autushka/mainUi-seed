# mainUi-seed

The goal of this project is to have a private portion of the "common" spring based web application. It is based on gulp-browserify boilerplate for angularjs (read here for more details: https://github.com/jakemmarsh/angularjs-gulp-browserify-boilerplate).

Main UI application
(user should be authenticated in order to use it)

In order to start the application execute in cmd in the root path:
- npm i; (will install npm packages dependencies)
- bower i; (will install js dependencies)
- gulp dev; (will produce build folder with final app that should be ready for production use)

Run the app on port 63769 by executing in cmd:
live-server --port=63769
from src/main/webapp/build folder
